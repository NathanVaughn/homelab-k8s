# Technitium DNS

## Setup

In Authentik, create a proxy provider for a single application with the URL
`https://technitium-dns.nathanv.app`. Ensure you assign the application to an outpost.

## Post Setup

The default login is `admin` and `admin`. You can create a new user
and give them super admin privileges, then disable the default account.
